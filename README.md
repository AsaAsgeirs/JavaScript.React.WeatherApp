# Weather App - React with API

**Note** as it is an mobile app you will have to resize your browser.

I made an mobile weather app where you can search for a city and you will get the city or country name, date and temperature. When you open the app you will get a search bar in the top and an landscape image of a mountain but when the degrees Celsius go above 12°c the background image changes to a more warm landscape.

Only thing that I couldn't fix was that some cities or even countries that you look up will go to towns in the US, like Rome, Greenland. I'm not sure if it is my code or if it is the API, I tried to fix it but I could not solve it. But if you have a better understanding then I do about APIs or coding and you have a suggestion how I could fix the problem then I'm all ears!

# API 
I used the API from Open Weather which is public. Here is a link: https://openweathermap.org/current

# Style
I used CSS to style the application.

# The project
I followed a youtube tutorial to make this App as I have not yet gotten full grasp of React and APIs 

I learned alot after following this tutorial and it was really fun to make. I think now i'm better prepared to learn more about  about React and APIs.

Overall it was a fun project :)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
